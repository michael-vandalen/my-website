    <h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
    Hi, my name is Michael van Dalen. I am currently studying software engineering and looking to become one oneday. I currently have no experience but I am looking for a internship to see what it would take and to see how it is. 
</p>
<p>
    I have a lot of passions but one of my biggest passions would have to be sports. I love watching and playing sports because it just is so exciting for me. I would say my two main sports I love watching is Rugby and Football. I also enjoy excercising as it gives me a moment to just be with myself and be peaceful for a bit.
</p>
<p>
    What motivates me is probably my family and friends. My family always backs me and has a belief in me that makes me feel as if I can do anything and same with my friends. Hopefully I can be successful one day with what ever may come in the future.
